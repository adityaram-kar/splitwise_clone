The Splitwise Clone is a full-stack web application designed to help groups manage shared expenses efficiently. Built with PHP, MySQL, jQuery, and Bootstrap, it allows users to create groups, add members, and track expenses, automatically calculating who owes whom. The application features a secure login system, real-time balance computation, and a settlement feature to record payments and close debts. Prepared statements with PDO prevent SQL injection, while htmlspecialchars() and password hashing ensure user input and credentials are protected. The interface is responsive and user-friendly, making it easy to add, edit, and delete expenses, and keep track of all financial transactions within a group.
